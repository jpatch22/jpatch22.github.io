                <ul>
                    <li>Developed a GUI in Python Using Tkinter to run model predictions and labelling. Interactive as you moved
                        your mouse over different parts of the image, showed the labels.<a

                    <li>Worked on setting up VCK5000 and figuring out how to run different models on the DPU. Worked on
                        Quantisation, Deployment of models and more.</li>
                    <li>Integrated Running Models on the application with the GUI. Implemented batch processing to the DPU, to demonstrate
                        maximum performance (IO component of time was significant).
                    </li>
                    <li>Built scripts to collect data (Power, Temperature, Voltages...) from the hardware and save to csv to track energy 
                        usage and other metrics during inference.

                <ul>
                    <li>Led machine learning effort to convert audio signal inputs into 3D spatial images implementing a
                        convolution neural network with TensorFlow.</li>
                    <li>Leveraged Wandb for rigorous tracking and dashboard analytics, streamlining experiment
                        record-keeping and enhancing model performance tuning.</li>

                    <li>
                        Built a simulation following a pivotal mathemetical paper on the theory of tipping points in 
                        climate change.
                    </li>
                    <li>This simulation models the effects of global warming on the Atlantic Meridional Overturning
                        Circulation (AMOC) using Python, providing insights into potential climate change scenarios.
